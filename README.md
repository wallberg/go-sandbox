# Fun with Programming

My playground for programming. At this time this mostly means using [Go](https://golang.org) to implement algorithms and solve problems from [TAOCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming).

Project Euler code is tracked in a separate private repo, but can be included here:

` git clone git@github.com:wallberg/project-euler.git com/github/wallberg/euler `
